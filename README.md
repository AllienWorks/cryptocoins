## Requesting new icons

Initial release contains just a fraction of Altcoins. If you're missing your coin, please let me know so I can include it in next release. Since there are many requests lately and I can hardly keep up, **I have to ask you to follow these guidelines**:

1. [open a new issue](https://github.com/allienworks/cryptocoins/issues/new) in this repo
2. fill in the template (coin name, ticker symbol, link to official logo etc.)
3. _(optional)_ you can include HEX code of the main color used in coin's branding and bitcointalk thread link (not mandatory, but saves me time)
4. (optional) you can notify me on [@AllienWorks](https://twitter.com/AllienWorks) Twitter (also, helps spreading the word)

**This is all completely voluntary work**, so if you want to support my efforts _or_ speed up the addition of your coin, [please donate](https://allien.work/about.html#donate). Donation addresses are found below (if you don't see your coin, let me know and I'll send the address afterwards).
